**Problem Statement:**

In the current legal system, the management of pre-hearing cases is plagued by inefficiencies, leading to extensive delays and a backlog of pending cases. Manual processes, including physical paperwork and limited communication channels, contribute to a lack of transparency and hinder the timely resolution of legal disputes. There is a pressing need for a secure and efficient online ecosystem that streamlines case management, promotes seamless communication, and ensures the timely resolution of legal disputes. The absence of a comprehensive digital platform hinders the effective collaboration between legal professionals and their clients, leading to a lack of trust in the legal system and a persistent backlog of pending cases. There is a clear demand for an integrated and secure solution that facilitates the digitization of case files, enhances communication, and promotes a sustainable approach to legal case management
